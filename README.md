# eCommerse-Flowers
It's a pure PHP project. The code is procedural.
I made it for a client. He will sell flowers and othe products with it.
Users can buy flowers, seeds, fertilizers and garden accessories.

There is a fully custom control panel.
The owner of the website can see the requests in the control panel and there he can do what he want with them.
Owner can log into the control panel with username and password.
The control panel lets the owner to: 

1. Add products for sale with more than one pitcure.
2. Add categories for the uploaded in the system products.
3. Add news for the uploaded products.
4. Delete categories for the products in the system.
5. Add, edit or remove promotions for the uploaded products.
6. To accept or refuse queries from the users.
7. To see which products are requested with total product price calculated by requested quantity.

I have made an effort to make the work with this website easy and I think I did it.
